# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Our project is under continuous development. We do not use a traditional versioning system (e.g., 5.1.x, 5.0.x). Instead, we provide security updates for the latest stable version available on the `main` branch.

| Branch | Supported          |
|--------|--------------------|
| `main` | :white_check_mark: |

If you are using an older commit or a fork, please update to the latest version from the `main` branch to ensure you have all the latest security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our application seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by creating a **confidential security advisory** through GitHub. This is the preferred and most secure method.

1.  Navigate to the **"Security"** tab of our repository.
2.  Click on **"Advisories"**.
3.  Click the **"Report a vulnerability"** button to open a new advisory.

Alternatively, you can email the project maintainer directly at **`security@example.com`** (please replace this with a real contact email if available).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide detailed information, including:
* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* The potential impact of the vulnerability.
* Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots.

### Our Commitment

If you report a vulnerability, we will:
* Acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
* Provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability's severity and impact.
* Keep you informed of our progress as we work on a fix.
* Notify you when the vulnerability has been patched. We aim to release a patch within **30 days** for critical vulnerabilities.

We thank you for helping to keep our project and its users safe.
